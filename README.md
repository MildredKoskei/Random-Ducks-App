## Setup

- Run `json-server --watch db.json` to get the backend started
- Open the `index.html` file on your browser
- Write your code in the `script.js` file

## Endpoints

The base URL for this API will be: `http://localhost:3000`

The endpoint needed  is:

- GET `https://random-d.uk/api/random`




## Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

-see a duck image on the `#card-image` and it should be new picture of a fox when the page is refreshed
- like the picture by clicking on the like button `#like-button` and the number of times liked should also be displayed by the like count `#like-count`
- Add a comment on the comment section and the comment should be displayed on a div section just below the likes section 
- A user  can also delete their comment before they submit their comment
